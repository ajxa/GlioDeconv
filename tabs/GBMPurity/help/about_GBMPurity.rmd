## About GBMPurity

GBMPurity is a machine learning model designed to estimate the purity of bulk RNA-seq primary IDH-wildtype Glioblastoma (GBM) samples. In this context, purity refers to the proportion of malignant cells within a tumour sample.

### Model Architecture and Training

Our model is a multi-layer perceptron trained on simulated pseudobulk tumours of known purity. These simulations were created using the GBmap single-cell resource ([Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.27.505439)).

For a detailed description of GBMPurity's architecture, training methodology, and performance metrics, please refer to our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/).

### How GBMPurity Works

1. **Data Input**: Upload a raw count matrix containing samples (columns) and genes (rows, using HGNC symbols). Alternatively, use our provided example dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The tool automatically filters and transforms the input data to prepare it for analysis.

3. **Purity Estimation**: The preprocessed data is fed into the GBMPurity model, which generates purity estimates for each sample.

4. **Results**: Purity estimates are presented in two formats:
   - A downloadable results table for use in downstream analysis
   - A beeswarm plot for visual representation of the purity distribution

### Development and Support

GBMPurity is a product of the Glioma Genomics group at the University of Leeds.
